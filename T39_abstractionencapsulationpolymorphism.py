"""
Abstraction : Not to tell user what is inside the function.
              Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it. For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget.



Encapsulation : Wrapping the functions and methods in to single entity.
                In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.



Polymorphism : Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.
               Poly means many and morphism means form. So the meaning is more than one form.
